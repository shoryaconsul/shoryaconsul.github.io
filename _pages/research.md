Decision forests are popular for both regression and classification but require a large number of queries for training. This makes attaining differential privacy especially challenging. We proposed a novel scheme, _DiPriMe forests_ that ensures differential privacy while maintaining high utility.

Reconstructing tumor populations from heterogeneous samples from high-throughput sequencing data is highly valuable area of study due to its potential to inform targeted studies and treatments. This, however, is a challenging task due to the complex mutations present and read lenghts being too short to span regions exhibitng structural variations. We present a novel algorithmic framework, _AMTHet_, to infer the tumor clonal populations and their frequencies from a heterogeneous sample based on copy number variations.
