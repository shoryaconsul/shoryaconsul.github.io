<br> 
I am a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by [Prof. Haris Vikalo](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~hvikalo/){:target="_blank"}.

My primary research interests include bionformatics and machine learning. One of my key thrusts is the development of algorithms and machine learning models for applications in genomics. I also hold a keen interest in the burgeoning field of ethical machine learning, specifically privacy.
