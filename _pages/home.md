<br> 
I am a late-stage PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by [Prof. Haris Vikalo](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~hvikalo/){:target="_blank"}.

I am chiefly interested in the applications of machine learning to data from the biological domain, especially genomic data. One of the major thrusts of my research is the development of deep learning-based algorithms for the analysis of DNA sequencing data mixtures. Some of my recent work has centered around the development of algorithmic frameworks utilizing transformers and foundational models.
I am also keenly interested in the burgeoning field of ethical machine learning, and privacy in particular.

**Hobbies:** Snuggling up with a good fantasy or mystery book, or being out playing tennis and ultimate frisbee. From time to time, I also love nerding out over trivia and sports.
