<br> 

I am excited to be working as a Senior Comptuational Scientist at [Quantum-Si](https://www.quantum-si.com/){:target="_blank"}. As part of the Data Sciences & Algorithms team, I focus on developing and maintening the algorithms and computational pipelines that power our cutting-edge instrumentation and drive innovative proteomics applications.


Prior to that, I had the privilege of compling my PhD in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, under the guidance of [Prof. Haris Vikalo](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~hvikalo/){:target="_blank"}. My doctoral research focused on the applications of machine learning to data from the biological domain, especially genomic data. This work included the development of (a) deep-learning based algorithms and (b) algorthmic frameworks predicated on foundational models for inference from DNA sequencing data mixtures.

I am also keenly interested in the burgeoning field of ethical machine learning, and privacy in particular.

**Hobbies:** Snuggling up with a good fantasy or mystery book, or being out playing tennis and ultimate frisbee. Also love to occasionally nerd out over trivia and board games.
